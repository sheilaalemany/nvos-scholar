# EnvoScholar v2.0
### Senior Project completed in Spring 2019

EnvoScholar is an academic search engine is specifically for researchers in the field of environmental science to search through, and save, and provide feedback for environmental peer reviewed articles. Users are able to:
- Create profiles so they can save articles and gain access to view their saved articles, along with their search history and click history. 
- Leave feedback on the overall user experience and can also browse the ENVO ontology using two visualization techniques, a treeview and node graph structure. 

This is version 2.0 of EnvoScholar, therefore, the final deliverable document will specifically talk about features that were added to this web application.

#### Source Files
The `Code` folder will contain all the program source files.

#### Documentation
The `Document` folder contains all the documentation for application include the user stories that were completed, the user stories that were not completed, the project plan, the system design, and the system validation. With the information provided in the documents, one will be able to understand how EnvoScholar works with its various components, and who did what for each feature.

The `Poster` folder contains the posters presented in the FIU Engineering Showcase to present the work we did in the semester. Photos from the event can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/fiu/albums/72157680003479428).
